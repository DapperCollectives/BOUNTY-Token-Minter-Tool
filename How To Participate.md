# Locating available bounties
- All bounty opportunities will be listed on the [Dapper Collectives Github](https://github.com/dappercollectives) page. We will continuously update this page as we assign new bounties.  Each bounty will live inside of its own repository that houses all of the necessary information associated with that specific bounty.
- New bounties will be shared to our [Github](https://github.com/dappercollectives) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_Collectives_) pages as soon as they become available. We recommend following both accounts and turning on alert notifications to stay current on all opportunities.


# Claiming a bounty
  1. If you find a bounty that you want to claim, please submit your claim proposal by raising an issue inside of the corresponding repository.
  2. This claim proposal should include a PRD that includes all team members, necessary team member information, a point of contact, and why your team is best suited for delivering this bounty. Please ensure that your proposal addresses all milestones outlined in the bounty description.
  3. We are aware that the PRD request is also the first milestone in the bounty process. Our aim is to align on expectations and bring the claiming team that much closer to the first reward amount.
  4. The first team that submits a claim proposal that is approved by the Dapper Collectives engineering team will have the opportunity to progress to the Bounty Submission Agreement stage. At this point, the bounty will be marked as claimed and we will reach out to the claiming team’s point of contact.

# Next steps
- Each bounty has been separated into four milestone phases. These phases are outlined in the bounty descriptions and may be different for each individual bounty.
- Our engineering team will guide the milestone check in process across all phases. This communication will remain public on Github to ensure transparency of the process.
- Each milestone will need to be approved by our internal teams before moving on to the next phase and/or receiving payment.

# Submitting for approval
  1. Similar to claiming a bounty, this approval process will also take place through raising an issue on Github inside of the specific bounty’s repository. Each milestone phase has its own set of objectives and methods of approval.
  2. Our internal team will work through the auditing and QA process, as necessary, and provide feedback. There will be an opportunity to discuss and resolve any issues found during the approval process.
  3. If an issue is discovered, we will discuss a timeline for the issue to be addressed and resolved before deeming the milestone unachieved. This will be decided on a case by case basis.
  4. If you fail, or have a poor performance at second and third milestones, you will get a chance to address issues once and have a follow-up review. If that follow-up review isn't satisfactory, you will be compensated a "kill fee" for work completed, turn over your work to date, and the bounty can be reassigned to a new team. This will be decided on a case by case basis.

# Once your bounty milestone is approved
If you’re at this stage, congratulations! This means your work has been approved and you will be rewarded with the corresponding bounty amount. We will work with you to provide payment within thirty days of approved completion.

# Receiving payment 
Upon milestone completion, you may submit an invoice to [dc-finance@dapperlabs.com](mailto:dc-finance@dapperlabs.com) for payment. Invoices must be detailed and include full name, address, contact information, bounty name, milestone number and wallet address.

# What happens if a team claims a bounty and then becomes unresponsive?
We hope this never happens, but in case it does, we’ve developed a tiered approach to give the team a chance to respond before removing their claim on the bounty. 

If a team has been unreachable and not made any form of official contact with anyone from our engineering team for two weeks then they will be labeled as “on alert.” This designation will be communicated from our team. If an additional two weeks passes, reaching a total of four weeks, with no contact or updates then the bounty claim will be revoked from your team, your work will be forfeited, and the bounty opportunity will be made available to the general public again.

# More questions?
If you have any questions that are not answered here, please reach out to us on Twitter (@_Collectives_) or to our team member Sage (xoxosageygal#0051) in the Flow and/or Flowverse discord.
