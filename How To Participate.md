### Locating available bounties

* All bounty opportunities will be listed on the [Flowverse website](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://flowverse-0b43bb.webflow.io/daos&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1648163726934654&usg=AOvVaw0wUvUsNWp4iAjDfjO8QKPY). Flowverse will continuously update this page as we assign new bounties. Each bounty will be classified as either Gold, Silver, or Bronze based on priority and reward amount. You will find all of the information associated with each individual bounty  on the Flowverse website.
* New bounties will be shared to the [Flowverse website](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://flowverse-0b43bb.webflow.io/daos&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1648163726935501&usg=AOvVaw3ui-m6o8IGZC5uRWAYSSsc),[Github](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/dappercollectives&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1648163726935814&usg=AOvVaw1Jm__9Q8etelnkDTifW8RR) and [Twitter](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/_Collectives_&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1648163726936049&usg=AOvVaw2KbDS83Raf0hh85-flMUW3) pages as soon as they become available. We recommend following the accounts and turning on alert notifications to stay current on all opportunities.

### Claiming a bounty

* Each bounty will live inside of its own repository that houses all of the necessary information associated with that specific bounty. If you find a bounty that you want to claim, please submit your claim proposal by raising an issue inside of the corresponding repository. This claim proposal should include a PRD write up/tech spec document that includes all team members, necessary team member information, a point of contact, and why your team is best suited for delivering this bounty. Please ensure that your proposal addresses all milestones outlined in the bounty description.
* The first team that submits a claim proposal that is approved by the Dapper Collectives engineering team will have the opportunity to progress to the Bounty Submission Agreement stage. At this point, the bounty will be marked as claimed on all platforms. Once the bounty is claimed, we will reach out to the team's point of contact whose claim proposal has been approved to enter into a Bounty Submission Agreement.

### Next steps

* Each bounty has been separated into four milestone phases. These phases are outlined in the bounty descriptions and may be different for each individual bounty. Our engineering team will guide the milestone check in process across all phases. This communication will remain public on Github to ensure transparency of the process. Our goal is to be a helpful resource throughout this process, doing our best to guide and empower the bounty team. Each milestone will need to be approved by our internal teams before moving on to the next phase and/or receiving payment.

### Submitting for approval

* Similar to claiming a bounty, this approval process will also take place through raising an issue on Github inside of the specific bounty's repository. Each milestone phase has its own set of objectives and methods of approval. Our internal team will work through the auditing and QA process, as necessary, and provide feedback. There will be an opportunity to discuss and resolve any issues found during the approval process. If an issue is discovered, we will discuss a timeline for the issue to be addressed and resolved before deeming the milestone unachieved. This will be decided on a case by case basis.
* If you fail, or have a poor performance at second and third milestones, you will get a chance to address issues once and have a follow-up review. If that follow-up review isn't satisfactory, you will be compensated a "kill fee" for work completed, turn over your work to date, and the bounty can be reassigned to a new team. This will be decided on a case by case basis.

### Once your bounty milestone is approved

* If you're at this stage, congratulations! This means your work has been approved and you will be rewarded with the corresponding bounty amount. We will work with you to provide payment within thirty days of approved completion.

# Payment Process

Upon milestone completion, you may submit an invoice to [dc-finance@dapperlabs.com](mailto:dc-finance@dapperlabs.com) for payment. Invoices must be detailed and include full name, address, contact information, bounty name, milestone number and wallet address.

# What happens if a team claims a bounty and then becomes unresponsive?

We hope this never happens, but in case it does, we've developed a tiered approach to give the team a chance to respond before removing their claim on the bounty. If a team has been unreachable and not made any form of official contact with anyone from our engineering team for two weeks then they will be labeled as "on alert." This designation will be communicated from our team. If an additional two weeks passes, reaching a total of four weeks, with no contact or updates then the bounty claim will be revoked from your team, your work will be forfeited, and the bounty opportunity will be made available to the general public again.

If you have any questions that are not answered here, please reach out to us on Twitter (@_Collectives_) or to our team member Sage (xoxosageygal#0051) in the Flow/Flowverse discord.
