# Overview

The Token Minter is an dapp that allows users to easily mint tokens onto the Flow blockchain using a guided process and GUI. This easy on-ramp for creating tokens of various kinds on Flow supports the growth of the Flow ecosystem by lowering barriers to entry and simplifying the process for deployment.

The Token Minter dapp should be aimed at a generalist audience that has limited experience with the technical aspects of deploying smart contracts, but understands enough of the mechanics to be able to fill in the details required to deploy the typical token contract. 

A user should be able to perform the following using the Token Minter dapp:

- Learn about how Non-Fungible Tokens on Flow work and their specific qualities
- Authenticate into the dapp using their Flow wallet address
- Enter key details for their NFT collection into a guided user flow
- Learn how to upload their assets and metadata to a service like IPFS
- Upload the metadata for their NFT collection 
- Review all of the details of their collection and preview the individual NFTs
- Initiate deployment and pay for any associated costs using their FLOW balance


# Key Features for Initial Release
- Auditable, open-source codebase
- Ability to mint collections of Non-Fungible Tokens following the existing token standard on Flow
- User-friendly and intuitive GUI that guides users through the deployment process
- Tablet- and mobile-friendly user interface
- Thorough documentation and walkthroughs for using the dapp

# Additional/Future Features
- Support for minting Fungible Tokens
- Documentation and walkthroughs in non-English languages

# Bounty Overview

Weâ€™re looking for small teams of experienced engineers and product designers who are excited to build out tools for the Flow ecosystem. Our bounty program favors builders that are interested in working collaboratively with Dapper Collectives to make Web3 more open and accessible to all. Every bounty is broken up into several milestones that allow teams to collect feedback, show progress, and collect milestone payments.

For the Token Minter project, the milestones are:

1. Product Requirements Documentation and Tech Spec Review + Acceptance
   - Provide a thorough PRD for how the Token Minter will work and associated technical documentation for how the product will be built. This should include a maintenance plan for the code once deployed.
   - Review the documentation with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect feedback and ensure the viability of the implementation
   - Due within 10-14 days from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone

2. Front-End Prototype Review + Acceptance
   - Provide a clickable prototype of the Token Minter front-end that clearly illustrates the anticipated user flows for a production build
   - Review the front-end prototype with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect UI/UX feedback
   - Due within 6-10 weeks from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone

3. Back-End and Smart Contract Review + Acceptance
   - Walk through the technical implementation of the back-end of the Token Minter and associated smart contracts
   - Review with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect feedback and ensure viability of the implementation
   - Due within 6-10 weeks from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone

4. Production-Grade Build Complete
   - Provide full codebase for the Token Minter for review by the Dapper Collectives team
   - Due within 4 weeks from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone
   - Upon reaching Milestone 4, the codebase for the Token Minter must be turned over to Dapper Collectives for deployment to Flow mainnet
